    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <pre>
Effective Date: 26 February 2026
Walquwa Min Al Iman respects your privacy. This app is designed to calculate Islamic prayer times primarily on your device.
We do not create user accounts.
We do not sell or share personal data.
We do not collect or store your location on our servers.
If you allow location access, your device uses it only to calculate accurate prayer times. Location data is processed on your device and is not transmitted to us.
The app may store your selected settings, such as calculation method or notification preferences, locally on your device so that your choices are remembered.
If enabled by your device or app store platform, technical crash reports may be generated. These reports may include non-identifying information such as device model or operating system version. We do not link this information to your identity.
You may disable location or notifications at any time in your device settings. Some features may not function properly if permissions are disabled.
We do not share personal data with third parties unless required by law.
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the app after updates means you accept the revised policy.
